# Grid Sketcher ‚úèÔ∏è‚úèÔ∏è‚úèÔ∏è

## Overview  

Sketch Grid Helper is a web-based application built to assist sketch artists with proportioning images onto any paper size using a flexible grid system. Users can upload any photo, apply a clean sketch-style filter, generate a grid based on paper dimensions, and hover over the canvas to get real-time coordinate feedback for accurate drawing placement. It‚Äôs simple, intuitive, and perfect for artists who want to trace or proportion their work accurately.

üöß **This project is currently under construction.** More features and design improvements are actively being added. The core functionality works, but styling, performance, and advanced tools are still being polished.
